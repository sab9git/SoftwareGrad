gameoflife.py written in Python3 using the latest Anaconda distribution.
It is heavily reccommended that Anaconda is installed, or that at least the numpy,
matpotlib and time distributions are imported.

Written by Stephen Brown for the BBC Software Grad Scheme.
This is my first time scripting in Python!

Script can be run directly from terminal using 'python3 gameoflife.py',
or by importing into python3 using os.chdir and 'import gameoflife'.
To start the game, run the gameoflife.main() function.
